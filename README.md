Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a company that deals with money, and they want to make their app safer. They do have some security installed, but they are going to add more security features so that users can be better protected. That means they attempt to make it that personal and financial information about people is private and secure when using their application.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I enjoyed the static testing of my code to locate weaknesses was quite interesting; this is a kind of health check of your code in order to find possible problems before some attacker tries to exploit them.

Why Secure Coding Matters
Writing secure code is of great significance because such code protects not only your information but also those of the users of your software. The leakage of personal information or confidential business data brings severe damage to individuals and enterprises alike.

Protection of Information and Reputation
By paying attention to secure coding, you help to protect sensitive information. It helps you not only avoid data leakage but also a company's reputation from being spoiled over time. If users know their data is well-guarded, then they are more willing to continue using the software in question.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
It was really helpful, due to the fact that a tool existed that made finding vulnerabilities so much easier since checking the dependencies was one of them. Instead of having to look over each dependency oneself to spot any issues, it was a way to speed up the process to find out if there would be a problem.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
Many of the security issues in software arise from using outdated libraries. This greatly improves the security of the software when these are updated. In this way, using penetration testing in the future will find and fix more weaknesses in the code.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
While working on the software, I continually tested it to ensure that everything was working as it should. Then, I tried to enhance the coding of the software; after that, I tested it again to find new problems or weaknesses.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Regarding coding, every time something went wrong, I always looked into Stack Overflow. It allows me to see how others tackle similar problems. That was pretty helpful when there was an error in the console. That allowed me to understand and solve some better challenges learned from my peers' solutions.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
My implementation of hash functions to encrypt communications, my ability to interperet a dependancy report and find solutions for any vulnerability.
